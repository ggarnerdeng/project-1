This is current working version. 

Linux Interface Tool (LIT) 
By: Garner Deng
 
	This tool allows a user to navigate a linux computer through a ssh connection, without needing
	to know any linux commands. Ssh into a remote computer on the same network using a username, 
	private IP address, and account password to login. Upon logging in, the user is instructed to 
	open up localhost:12345 in a web browser. A HTML page will be used to display some options of 
	the tool. Some options such as 'viewing all processes', 'list all files' and etc are provided.
	This is a basic implementation of an interface that allows a user to use command line 
	executions without knowing the actual commands for that OS(in this case, linux). 

	To run: import the necessary dependancies listed, if file is not built. Execute by clicking the	executable file, or by running "go main.go" if application is in source code form.
